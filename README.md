# Hooptie-Robo

Do you have a end of life car at your garage or can you find one at your nearby junk shop? We might need you. 
Introducing Hooptie-robo, a economical and autonomous car for your everyday need. 


## Motivation of the project 

The project Hooptie Robo is an independent research based project to develop an economical autonomous vehicle. 
The current challenges in Automobile Industry in the year 2023 includes:

1. Due to covid-19 the sales in the automobile Industry has reduced and remains stagnant for a long time. 
2. Inventory shortage, growing demand for online services. 
3. Police and Emergency response - Identifying connected AV to track illegal activities ( for example, transportation of drugs).
4. Massive layoff - loss of labor. 
5. Difficulty to analyse buying pattern in customers. 

On keeping these key points in mind, our project Hooptie-robo focuses on:

1. Research and presentation on pros and cons of hooptie cars turning autonomous. 
2. Online Survey - the need for online services in AV.
3. Market analysis of Hooptie cars in Germany (Buying patterns in customers, financial loss analysis, hooptie cars analysis in Germany)
4. Object detection and classification for driving scenario. 
5. Research and brain strom on new features to introduce in hooptie-robo
6. Simuntaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique. 
7. Path planning. 
8. Pygame to visualize output.
